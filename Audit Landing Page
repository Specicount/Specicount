ANU researchers in the fields of ecology/palaeoecology are interested in collaborating with TechLauncher to develop an app that would streamline the identification, counting and analysis of ecological data. In the first instance, focus would be on creation a more efficient data capture process for pollen analysis. With pollen analysis we can reconstruct landscape and climate change over tens to thousands of years, explore the health of pollination systems in agricultural and ecosystem science and monitor the respiratory health of our cities.

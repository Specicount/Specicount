# <a name='project_brief'></a> 1. Project Brief

ANU researchers in the fields of ecology/palaeoecology are currently using a system of analysing pollen in environmental samples that is cumbersome and largely paper-based. 
The objective of this project is to digitise the data capture methods of our client to help simplify their workload and increase productivity. 
We will accomplish this objective through the creation of a web application that would replace the paper-based step in the current workflow.

# <a name='project_background'></a> 2. Project Background

Our clients, Rebecca Hamilton & Janelle Stevenson, are currently involved in the research project *The Pace and Rhythm
of Climate: 600,000 Years in a Biological Hotspot*. The aim of the research project is to
create a vegetation and fire record of Sulawesi, Indonesia over a 600,000-year period. This
research has ramifications within the study of climate change over a large timeframe, using
this area as a hotspot for further research and study. The clients' specific role within the
project is to analyse the pollen samples provided from the sedimentary extracts, and record
this combined with the presence of charcoal to indicate patterns of vegetation and fire
within the area.

The current methodology used for data capture is paper-based tally sheets, with the
reference material being organised online through image-storing websites such as “Flickr”.
The client currently uses these reference photos combined with reference tags to attempt
to identify the pollen samples found, and record this. Once all items are recorded, the data
is then manually fed back into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and exported into graphing
programs to discover trends and publish to other participants within the project.

While bespoke image storage systems such as using "Flickr" exist, the ANU has been instrumental
in providing a web-based reference for the pollen and spores found in the Australasian ecosystem.
The Australasian Pollen and Spore Atlas (APSA) is partially populated from large on-site collection housed 
at ANU, and gives researchers the chance to share knowledge without the hassle of travel.

Although APSA exists, it has been unmoderated and has become unkept in the last 10 years.
The ANU wishes to perform a re-launch of the website, encouraging greater use within and outside ANU.

# <a name='project_description'></a> 3. Project Description

The objective of the project is to digitise the data capture methods currently used to reduce the Clients' workload and increase productivity. This includes the
ability to have a portable application that captures, sorts and organises the data to be exported to the graphing software used within the wider project community.
Although the initial scope is purely for the prototype to be used in the Clients' research project, the vision of the Clients is to produce a polymorphic application that can be used
in the wider research community for multiple data capture senarios, eliminating the need for paper-based methods in the forthcoming digital age. Furthermore, integration with the APSA
database is to be discussed and a feasibility study is to be performed for future developers.

# <a name='the_website'></a> 8. The Website

We are currently hosting the website on:
* A virtual machine located on campus provided by ANU for student projects - This is used as the production server where the client and auditors can test the functionality of the site. We push changes from the development server to this server every time major changes are made.

You can view and play around with our current prototype at [http://seprojgrp2b.anu.edu.au](http://seprojgrp2b.anu.edu.au).
We only ask that you **don't delete anything**, thank you!
(Note: this server can only be accessed on the ANU campus or via the [ANU VPN](https://services.anu.edu.au/information-technology/login-access/virtual-private-network-0)).

The Australasian Pollen and Spore Atlas (APSA) website can be found [here](http://apsa.anu.edu.au), and a code repository will be available to view once the team has gained access to the existing server.

The project is housed on an Apache2 server using PHP 7 and other items which can be found in our [Technical Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ObKv17vrhDEsHHpE8ep23V5kh7Y6Wm3NpOwPVRjhlc/edit?usp=sharing). You can view the [source code](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u6053577/BioData/) on GitLab.

Although the code and database is largly bespoke, a few tools have been employed to create this project. These include:
* [PHP Form Builder](https://www.phpformbuilder.pro/) for CRUD operations to the database
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling
* [Fontawesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons
* [Jquery 3](https://jquery.com/) for enhanced javascript
* [Bsadmin](https://github.com/kjdion84/bsadmin) for basic website template
* [Popper](https://popper.js.org/) for positioning HTML elements
* [hoverIntent](https://github.com/briancherne/jquery-hoverIntent) for mouse hover functionality

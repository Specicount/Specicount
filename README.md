# Project Brief

ANU researchers in the fields of ecology/palaeoecology are currently using a system of analysing pollen in environmental samples that is cumbersome and largely paper-based. The objective of this project is to digitise the data capture methods of our client to help simplify their workload and increase productivity. We will accomplish this objective through the creation of a web application that would replace the paper-based step in the current workflow.

# Project Background

Our clients, Rebecca Hamilton & Janelle Stevenson, are currently involved in the research project *The Pace and Rhythm
of Climate: 600,000 Years in a Biological Hotspot*. The aim of the research project is to
create a vegetation and fire record of Sulawesi, Indonesia over a 600,000-year period. This
research has ramifications within the study of climate change over a large timeframe, using
this area as a hotspot for further research and study. The clients' specific role within the
project is to analyse the pollen samples provided from the sedimentary extracts, and record
this combined with the presence of charcoal to indicate patterns of vegetation and fire
within the area.

The current methodology used for data capture is paper-based tally sheets, with the
reference material being organised online through image-storing websites such as “Flickr”.
The client currently uses these reference photos combined with reference tags to attempt
to identify the pollen samples found, and record this. Once all items are recorded, the data
is then manually fed back into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and exported into graphing
programs to discover trends and publish to other participants within the project.

# Project Description

The objective of the project is to digitise the data capture methods currently used to reduce the Clients' workload and increase productivity. This includes the
ability to have a portable application that captures, sorts and organises the data to be exported to the graphing software used within the wider project community.
Although the initial scope is purely for the prototype to be used in the Clients' research project , the vision of the Clients is to produce a polymorphic application that can be used
in the wider research community for multiple data capture senarios, eliminating the need for paper-based methods in the forthcoming digital age.

#### Role Descriptions

* *Team Leader* - Responsible for assigning tasks, motivating others and looking for ways to keep the project moving forward. The Team Leader should be involved with whatever work is currently happening and should, in general, adopt a greater workload than everybody else. The Team Leader is also responsible for any downfalls the project experiences during their leadership. This role will be rotated between the team members throught the course of the project and should be assigned to whoever has the expertise needed for the current phase of the project.
* *Communications Lead* - Responsible for any communication between Clients, Project group, Shadow group and other Stakeholders. Leads presentations.
* *Back-End Lead Developer* - The back-end developer that makes executive decisions on hardware, software and other functional design choices. Also shoulders a fairly hefty coding workload.
* *Back-End Developer* - Responsible for developing the core website functionality. This includes server creation and administration, database design and coding a basic website template.
* *Front-End Lead Developer* - The front-end developer that makes executive decisions on UI design choices. Expresses the vision for our project through mock sketches of potential website layouts.
* *Front-End Developer* - Responsible for UI design and ensuring responsiveness across devices. Will refine the HTML and CSS produced by the back-end developers.
* *Repository Control* - Responsible for creating, updating and organising documents on our repository.
* *Testing Lead* - Responsible for gathering feedback from testers and passing those evaluations on to the rest of the team.

# Stakeholders

* Dr Rebecca Hamilton - Client
    * Wants a streamlined data capture process to assist in her research
* Dr Janelle Stevenson - Research Project Primary Investigator, Client
    * Wants the research project to succeed
    * Wants a streamlined data capture process to assist in:
        * her own research 
        * the teaching of her students in the lab
* Elliott, Matthew, Alex, Paige - Project Team
    * Want to produce a useful/valuable product

##### Potential Stakeholders

* The broader scientific community
    * Can adapt our project/application for their needs

# Meetings Schedule

##### Client Meetings
We aim for weekly meetings but frequency also depends on necessity.
* 2pm-4pm every Tuesday (with the exception of Week 8, where we will be running testing on students in another timeslot)

##### Team Meetings
Will meet in person if everyone is available, otherwise over google hangouts with screenshare.
* 1pm-2pm every Tuesday (used as debrief for any work performed over weekend and establishing agenda for client meeting)
* 12pm-1:30pm every Thursday (used as debrief from tutorial and planning time for work until following Tuesday)

# Current Work

We currently hosting the website on:
* A server in Matthew's house - This is used for development and where we push live changes immediately
* A virtual machine located on-campus provided by ANU for student projects - This is used as the production server where the client and auditors can test the functionality of the site. We push changes from the development server to this server every time major changes are made.
(Note: this server can only be accessed on the ANU campus or via the [ANU VPN](https://services.anu.edu.au/information-technology/login-access/virtual-private-network-0)).

**We have currently closed access to our prototype due to official testing starting soon. We hope to have something up for you soon. :)**

The project is housed on Apache2 server using PHP 7 and other items which can be found in our [Technical Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ObKv17vrhDEsHHpE8ep23V5kh7Y6Wm3NpOwPVRjhlc/edit?usp=sharing).

Although the code and database is largly bespoke, a few tools have been employed to create this project. These include:
* [PHP Form Builder](https://www.phpformbuilder.pro/) for CRUD operations to the database
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling
* [Fontawesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons
* [Jquery 3](https://jquery.com/) for enhanced javascript
* [Bsadmin](https://github.com/kjdion84/bsadmin) for basic website template
* [Popper](https://popper.js.org/) for bsadmin (dependency)
* [Flexbin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flexbin) for displaying specimen images in grid format
* [hoverIntent](https://github.com/briancherne/jquery-hoverIntent) for mouse hover functionality

# Project Brief

ANU researchers in the fields of ecology/palaeoecology are currently using a system of analysing pollen in environmental samples that is cumbersome and largely paper-based. The objective of this project is to digitise the data capture methods of our client to help simplify their workload and increase productivity. We will accomplish this objective through the creation of a web application that would replace the paper-based step in the current workflow.


# Project Background

Our client, Ms. Hamilton, is currently assisting in completing the research project *The Pace and Rhythm
of Climate: 600,000 Years in a Biological Hotspot*. The aim of the research project is to
create a vegetation and fire record of Sulawesi, Indonesia over a 600,000-year period. This
research has ramifications within the study of climate change over a large timeframe, using
this area as a hotspot for further research and study. The client’s specific role within the
project is to analyse the pollen samples provided from the sedimentary extracts, and record
this combined with the presence of charcoal to indicate patterns of vegetation and fire
within the area.

The current methodology used for data capture is paper-based tally sheets, with the
reference material being organised online through image-storing websites such as “Flickr”.
The client currently uses these reference photos combined with reference tags to attempt
to identify the pollen samples found, and record this. Once all items are recorded, the data
is then manually fed back into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and exported into graphing
programs to discover trends and publish to other participants within the project.

#### Role Descriptions

* *Team Leader* - Responsible for motivating others and keeping the team on track - i.e. making sure we do what needs to be done.
* *Communications Lead* - Responsible for any communication between Clients, Project group, Shadow group and other stakeholders. Leads presentations.
* *Back-End Lead Developer* - A back-end developer that makes executive decisions on hardware, software and other functional design choices. Also shoulders a fairly hefty coding workload.
* *Back-End Developer* - Responsible for developing the core website functionality. This includes server creation and administration, database design and coding a basic website template.
* *Front-End Lead* - A front-end developer that makes executive decisions on UI design choices. Expresses the vision for our project through mock sketches of potential website layouts.
* *Front-End Lead Developer* - Responsible for UI design and ensuring responsiveness across devices. Will refine the HTML and CSS produced by the back-end developers.
* *Repository Control* - Responsible for creating, updating and organising documents on our repository.
* *Testing Lead* - Responsible for gathering feedback from testers and passing those evaluations on to the rest of the team.

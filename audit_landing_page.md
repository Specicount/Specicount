# Project Brief

ANU researchers in the fields of ecology/palaeoecology are currently using a system of analysing pollen in environmental samples that is cumbersome and largely paper-based. The objective of this project is to digitise the data capture methods of our client to help simplify their workload and increase productivity. We will accomplish this objective through the creation of a web application that would replace the paper-based step in the current workflow.

# Project Background

Our client, Ms. Hamilton, is currently assisting in completing the research project *The Pace and Rhythm
of Climate: 600,000 Years in a Biological Hotspot*. The aim of the research project is to
create a vegetation and fire record of Sulawesi, Indonesia over a 600,000-year period. This
research has ramifications within the study of climate change over a large timeframe, using
this area as a hotspot for further research and study. The client’s specific role within the
project is to analyse the pollen samples provided from the sedimentary extracts, and record
this combined with the presence of charcoal to indicate patterns of vegetation and fire
within the area.

The current methodology used for data capture is paper-based tally sheets, with the
reference material being organised online through image-storing websites such as “Flickr”.
The client currently uses these reference photos combined with reference tags to attempt
to identify the pollen samples found, and record this. Once all items are recorded, the data
is then manually fed back into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and exported into graphing
programs to discover trends and publish to other participants within the project.

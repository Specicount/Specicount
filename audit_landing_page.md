# Project Brief

The objective of the project is to digitise the data capture and analysis methods to help
simplify the workload of the client and increase productivity. The client wishes to have a
portable application that can be used to capture the data, sort the captured data and export
this to graphing software. The photo-based system is also required to be interfaced so the
existing work performed is not nullified if the application is adopted as accepted practice. As
an extension, the application should also be polymorphic to other uses within the scientific
community such as field reporting, allowing the application to be used as a tool in multiple
scenarios. Further to this, a basic image identification system that could sort an input into
multiple groups is requested. This would be used to sort initial sedimentary extract slides
into specific pollen groups, that can be studied in an order to improve productivity.

# Project Background

Ms. Hamilton is currently assisting in completing the research project The Pace and Rhythm
of Climate: 600,000 Years in a Biological Hotspot. The aim of the research project is to
create a vegetation and fire record of Sulawesi, Indonesia over a 600,000-year period. This
research has ramifications within the study of climate change over a large timeframe, using
this area as a hotspot for further research and study. The client’s specific role within the
project is to analyse the pollen samples provided from the sedimentary extracts, and record
this combined with the presence of charcoal to indicate patterns of vegetation and fire
within the area.
The current methodology used for data capture is paper-based tally sheets, with the
reference material being organised online through image-storing websites such as “Flickr”.
The client currently uses these reference photos combined with reference tags to attempt
to identify the pollen samples found, and record this. Once all items are recorded, the data
is then manually fed back into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and exported into graphing
programs to discover trends and publish to other participants within the project.

..* Hello


With pollen analysis we can reconstruct landscape and climate change over tens to thousands of years, explore the health of pollination systems in agricultural and ecosystem science and monitor the respiratory health of our cities.

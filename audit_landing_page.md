# Project Brief

This project is aimed at helping ANU researchers in the fields of ecology/palaeoecology streamline the identification, counting and analysis of ecological data. The current system of analysing pollen in environmental samples is cumbersome and largely paper-based. Our goal is to create a web application that will increase the efficiency of this data capture process.

# Contextual Information (or Background Information)

With pollen analysis we can reconstruct landscape and climate change over tens to thousands of years, explore the health of pollination systems in agricultural and ecosystem science and monitor the respiratory health of our cities.
